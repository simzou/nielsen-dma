### Credits

* Map adapted from Mike Bostock's [map example](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2206590)
* Original topojson made by converting shapefile from [here](http://geocommons.com/overlays/306767) to topojson via [Mike Bostock's instructions](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/)
     * Shapefile link is dead, an archived Geojson from Geocommons can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geoiq/gc_data/master/datasets/998.geojson)
* Nielsen rank and TV data via [tvb](http://www.tvb.org/media/file/TVB_Market_Profiles_Nielsen_Household_DMA_Ranks2.pdf)

### Notes

* Some areas are shaped really strangely (such as a slice of Nevada being part of the Denver media market) but that is really how they are divided
